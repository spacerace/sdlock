to start sdlock use "sdlock-launcher.sh"-script.
Inside this script you can set up your screen resolution as well as your
password and a few other things.
Simply open with a text editor.

Three files:
sdlock
sdlock.png
sdlock-launcher.sh

should be placed into your home folder as follows:

~/.sdlock
~/.sdlock.png
~/.sdlock-launcher.png

For this job to be done you can use the sdlock-install.sh script.

Now you can start sdlock via ~/.sdlock-launcher.sh
